  <h2>Relevant Projects</h2>
  <h3>Emotion Detection Using Video Logs</h3>
  The real time video stream from the tutoring system is used to detect a student's engagement levels. Patterns in facial action unit intensities is exploited to identify the causual emotional state in a student. The research studies the interaction between the student engagement and his learning.
  <h3>RL as a Service for Smarter Tutoring</h3>
  <p>There are two parts to this project. One is to use Reinforcement Learning to pick the best next pedagogical action in a tutoring system. The other is to build this as a service to be available for consumption in a generlized architecture for tutoring (<a href="https://github.com/GeneralizedLearningUtilities/SuperGLU">SuperGLU</a>).</p>
  <h3>Emotion Detection Using Interaction Logs</h3>
  <p>Towards building a cost effective emotional state detector for tutoring systems, the zero dollar solution is to exploit the interaction logs of a student. The best classifiers performed 38% better than chance. A significant effort was also put in feature engineering. No third party tool was used. </p>
