  <h3>Emotion Detection Using Video Logs</h3>
  <p>The real time video stream from the tutoring system is used to detect a student's engagement levels. Patterns in facial action unit intensities is exploited to identify the causual emotional state in a student. The research studies the interaction between the student engagement and his learning.</p>
  <h3><a class="link" href="https://github.com/GeneralizedLearningUtilities/SuperGLU" >RL as a Service for Smarter Tutoring</a></h3>
  <p>There are two parts to this project. One is to use Reinforcement Learning to pick the best next pedagogical action in a tutoring system. The other is to build this as a service to be available for consumption in a generalized library for tutoring (<a href="https://github.com/GeneralizedLearningUtilities/SuperGLU">SuperGLU</a>).</p>

  <h3><a class="link" href="https://github.com/Shamya/EmotionDetectionInteractionLogs">Emotion Detection Using Interaction Logs</a></h3>
  <p>Towards building a cost effective emotional state detector for tutoring systems, the zero dollar solution is to exploit the interaction logs of a student. The best classifiers performed 38% better than chance. A significant effort was also put in feature engineering. No third party tool was used. </p>
