	I have handled the planning and execution of the FY13 activities for the Kaikondrahalli Government school in Bangalore. An year in the School Adopt program (SAP) starts with desigining the month long summer camp aimed at the overall development of the kids followed by the school kit distribution. Various activities are organized for the kids in an year during the  occasion of independence day, republic day etc. There is also the annual health and eye checkups. 
	<br>
    	I have also organized and volunteered at various other activities like coordinating a checkpoint at Oxfam 100k trailwalk blood donation camps, global hunger relief campaigns, rural school visits, annual fair for Cisco Connected Women, canine shelter visits, classroom construction, etc. As a recognition to this effort, I was elected as the youngest board member of Cisco's <a href="http://csr.cisco.com/pages/about-cisco-csr">India Civic Council</a>.
