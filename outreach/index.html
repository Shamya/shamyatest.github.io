	<p>
	I have handled the planning and execution of the FY13 activities for the Kaikondrahalli Government school in Bangalore. An year in the School Adopt program (SAP) starts with the month long summer camp which intents at the overall development of the kids followed by the school kit distribution which includes uniform, a pair of shoes, books and bags. Various activities are organized for the kids in an year during the  occasions like independence day, republic day etc. There is also the annual health and eye checkups. <br>
    I have also organized and volunteered for various activities like blood donation camps, global hunger relief campaigns, rural school visits, annual fair for CCW(Cisco Connected Women), canine shelter visits, fundraisers, classroom construction, student outing camps etc. As a recognition to this effort, I was elected as the youngest board member of India Civic Council.
