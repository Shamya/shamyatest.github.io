        <h1>Vision</h1>
	<p>Quoting my advisor <a href=" http://althea.cs.umass.edu/bpw/bpwindex.html"> Prof Bevelery Woolf</a>, artificial intelligence in education is a field that explores theories about learning and builds software that delivers <em>differential teaching</em>. The teaching response is adapted to student needs after reasoning about domain knowledge, student mastery and pedagogy. I feel a strong connection to this field as it is the perfect union of my computer science skills, my vision to make education openly available and the need to empower every underprivileged child in the world. These tutors have a great potential to customize their tutoring strategy to the needs of each student, which is difficult to do in a traditional educational setting. An intelligent tutoring system(ITS) can compensate for the dearth of infrastructure and human labor in places like rural India.</p>
	
	<h2>Current Areas of Focus</h2>
	<h3>Emotion Detection</h3>
	<p>Many studies suggest that an emotional state of a student interacts with his/her engagement and learning. Affect detection is an important step towards improving student engagement in a tutoring system. An accurate detector of negative emotional states would allow for a variety of improved responses in tutors, such as interventions for disengagement repair.</p>
	
	<h3>Cutltural Sensitization</h3>
	<p>The current tutors are insensitive to the cultural backgrounds of the students. I fear that children in my country cannot attain academic achievement with the current tutors without compromising their ethnic and cultural identity. Also, considering culture in teaching has proved to improve a student’s learning gain. I plan to explore methods to build cultural intelligence into these tutors to better respond to a student’s need.</p>
