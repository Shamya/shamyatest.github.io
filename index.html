  <p>I am a first year graduate student at <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/">UMass Amherst</a> researching on using Machine Learning for Education. I dream of a world where every child irrespective of their background has an unbiased opportunity to learn their field of interest. I am currently advised by Prof <a href="http://centerforknowledgecommunication.com/05bpwabout.html">Beverly Woolf</a>.
