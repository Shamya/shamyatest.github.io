  <p>I am a first year graduate student at <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/">UMass Amherst</a> researching on using Machine Learning for Education. I dream of a world where every child irrespective of their background has an unbiased opportunity to learn their field of interest. </p>
  <p>I am currently advised by Prof <a href="http://centerforknowledgecommunication.com/05bpwabout.html">Beverly Woolf</a> at the <a href="http://centerforknowledgecommunication.com/index.html">Center for Knowledge Communication</a> lab. I am also a visiting researcher at the <a href="http://ict.usc.edu/">USC Institute of Creative Technologies </a> working with Prof <a href ="https://sites.google.com/site/benjaminnye/"> Benjamin Nye</a>. I was previously working with <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/index.html"> Cisco Systems</a> as a software engineer.
