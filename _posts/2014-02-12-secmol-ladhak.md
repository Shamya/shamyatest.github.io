As you drive on NH1 after the Leh military area, you see a humble board that read "Phey Village 5.5 KM". Taking a left, you enter a beautiful world guarded by the mighty Ladakh mountains and portrayed just in white-brown except for the glimpse of a few colorful Buddhist prayer flags.In this freezing winter, a warm cozy camp waits for you to unleash the magic of the indigenous use of natural resources.

A community to give the right opportunity to the deserving Ladakhi students victimized by the cultural differences in the current education system. Striving mostly on the natural resources, this community is in a constant refinement of its sustainable model of an ideal eco-society.

Near 100% replacement of electricity with solar power, LPG with biogas, fertilizers with humanure, synthetic processed food with organic homemade food products - consciously designed equipments for the optimized use of energy... Advanced yet traditional !!

Days spent here, brought back memories of the good old hostel days... A Perfect blend of Culture and technology. Hats off SECMOL to have created the warmest campus in the coldest place - Naturally.
