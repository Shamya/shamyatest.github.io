The journey to a trek basecamp in itself is quite rewarding. This is a constant pattern I have observed in most of them, especially reaching a Himalayan trailhead. Hope you would acknowledge experiencing some of these - sometimes even on the visits to your village in a ghat.

Close to the train or bus station of the nearest town, you usually find this modest looking local bus with a perfect driver-conductor pair luring the locals to board their bus. Only when the bus is out of the town boundaries, is when this driver transforms to become Michael Schumacher. From then on, you just trust your life in the hands of this under aged, under nourished chap who is no less than an F1 racer - just that he would be racing on the broken rocky roads of the hills. If there is something soothing, it’s just the romantic pahadi songs that he bestows upon us with his DJ effects.

A hair pin bend is just another jolly ride - there is no question of decelerating anyways. The result is just another passenger puking his organs out due to motion sickness. There would at least be a couple of road clearing work on the way - making way for the vehicles through the landslides of the previous day. And of course a couple of broken bridges. The big signboards keep warning with its witty quotes of why he shouldn’t be driving so recklessly. Nevertheless, they are just politely ignored by our racer boy.

As a layman, you would have assumed that it is humanly impossible for two buses to fit in that road. At the top of a steep valley, with a mainstream river flowing in its fullest at the base, with an absolute zero protection for your vehicle from tripping down - you have the occasional attacks of a fellow racer racing head-on in the opposite direction. Just when you loose all your hope on surviving, you witness the best stunt of your racer. In a split second, the buses stop, there is an exchange of signal and you are back on the trail racing again.

Amidst all this chaos, there is this beauty not be ignored. The beauty of the untouched villages you cross - the temples, the cattle, the kids covering their miles to school, a group of oldies chewing tobacco, women washing clothes and men fixing their cycles. If you ever happened to ask your fellow passenger about how far your destination is, the answer is quiet simple - the number of villages to be crossed. Why complicate things by measuring the distance! 

Anyways, after the breaks and bumps and broken bones, all the passengers with the sheep and goats and chickens in bus reach our destination safe and sound. Hats off to all the brave drivers of the mountains who connect us with the unconnected !!
