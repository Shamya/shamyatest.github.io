With all the buzz about waste management, collecting wastes at the doorstep has become a serious routine. I see a healthy, handsome dog come to my home everyday sharp at 9:10AM. It went on for a few days. I couldn't resist my curiosity and asked my mom if it was the neighbor's new dog. She laughed at it and said that it's the waste dog. I was furious at my mom's rudeness.

She went on to explain that this dog is rather the dog of the waste collection van. Like the hutch pug, it starts in the morning with the van and sleeps under it in the night.
Irrespective of who is employed to collect the waste, the dog is the supervisor. He sniffs at the garbage bag and approves it. If he feels there is something that could be recycled, he demands it to be taken out and has a happy meal out of it. He does his 10K interval training by running with the van from house to house to cover the whole locality. He is in fact so famous in our locality now, that it's a new trend for people to keep aside a quick bite for him to support his run !

Life could be so much more simpler if we worked more on our health and happiness. That's to our iconic waste dog !!!
