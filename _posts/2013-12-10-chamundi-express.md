In the 3 hours journey from Bangalore to Mysore in a train, there is no dearth of entertainment.

Let it be for the bisi bisi Maddur Vade, tea-chai tea-chai, kadle kai, churmuri or the hot discussion about Karnataka Politics by a bunch of middle-aged men returning home after work. Chamundi Express has it all !

For most of the time, you end up finding a common interest with the person sitting next to you and your journey seems too short to conclude the discussion.

For the other times, you always have the beautiful kabbina thota (sugarcane fields) to your either sides to treat your eyes and a bunch of kids waving a happy goodbye at you...

I love Mysore-Banglore trainsâ€¬ !!!
