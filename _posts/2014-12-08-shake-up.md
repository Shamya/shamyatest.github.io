As I walk to my bus stop, I see a happy couple walking out of a fancy restaurant - probably after a sumptuous dinner. When I walk past them, I hear their child demanding an ice cream. Not able to deny their little darling, they let her choose her favorite flavor.

A little lick and she is done fulfilling her desire. Carelessly, she tosses it over a garbage dump and joins her loving parents with all giggles on her dad's joke.

In the background is an old man watching this family cautiously - making me suspicious. He stays with his eyes fixed on them until they get in their car. They drive away happy laughing at something. 

As I wonder what the old man was intending to do, he races up to the garbage dump to pick the melting ice cream up. His eyes curse his old knees to have failed him to get on time to grab the most of it. As I watch him helplessly, I repent to have doubted him earlier.

Neither is the kid at fault nor is the man a victim. Nor can I think of a perfect solution for his hunger. I just stand there pondering - Isn't there just adequate resource in the world ? - probably there is just a need for it to be shaken up a little to settle in the gaps !
