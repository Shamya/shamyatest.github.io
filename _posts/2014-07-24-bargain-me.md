I always considered bargaining as one of my fundamental rights - never missing a chance to exercise it. Handcrafts always disappointed me in this aspect.

So what if the artisan spent hours crafting it. Should I prefer it over something which is way cheaper ? Absolutely No !
So what if its made of recycled materials and is eco friendly. Is it water proof, heat proof ? Mostly No !
Hmm.. i think its a little disproportionate. Can it be discounted ?

I had enough reasons not to buy a handcrafted product as i had to spend 2X money on a Bollywood movie on a weekend. Trying my hands at one of these myself, I realized how much more valuable these are than their machine made counterparts. Its an art !  Its a living for those souls who are the only few left unaffected by the urbanization ! Its beautiful coz its mostly natural ! Well for the fancy new trend - Its Eco-Friendly ! 

Lets respect the true artisans and support the very few left around us.. It does take a lot of time, effort and finesse to build each one of their product.. And for the bargains - we always have our subzi wala !
