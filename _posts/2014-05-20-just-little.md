The day i learnt to enjoy the droplets on my window, i forgot the joy of jumping into the rain.

The day i succumbed to the comforts of flying, i forgot to make friends with the stranger next to me in a train.

The day i moved to our fancy new house, i forgot the noises of our daily gully cricket.

The day i adored the luxury of a vehicle, i forgot to wave at my neighbors on my way to the market.

Things are so advanced yet its such a cold town

just a little more for me to break down...
